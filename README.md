# ReadLargeFiles
Reading files over the network is tricky, particularly the large ones which needs buffering. This repo is to track continuous practice on various concepts in file uploads over the network or within the system process

## Dependencies
You will need node(>= v9) and npm installed(>= v5)

## Installation
`npm install`

## How to run
node index.js

## What does this do?
Reads any file with a name `sample-large-file.jpg` of any size and streams them into a new file `complete.jpg`. You can put in any file with any size. This repo is for my own practice and for anybody wanting the knowledge about streaming large files
